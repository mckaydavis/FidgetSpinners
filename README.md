# The HRS App
*More than just a search engine.*

When we designed and implemented this application, we wanted to make this more than a traditional search. We wanted to create an app that could effectively search the current Hawaii Revised Statutes in a way that was new and innovative. Our goal for this app was to echo the very essence of being more than a search engine. As result, we created a new experience for the user. 

The HRS App takes into account the following issues:

* Can't effectively search the HRS.
* Can't find cross references in the HRS.
* Difficult to search for statutes located on signs around Hawaii.
* Not knowing what laws are relavant to your location.
* Having to note down laws you reference daily. 

## What we built
The very core of our application is a search engine, but in addition to that, we integrated tools that the user utilizes on a daily basis. As part of the application, we made use of optical recognition and location to further enhance the search experience. Instead of having to type the chapter and section of a statute, I could instead take a picture of it and get the result on my phone. Instead of manually figuring out what laws are relevant to my area, wtih a click of a button, I can see the laws nearest to my location. When we built this, we made sure to create an app at the highest level of quality. Our hope is for this app to become part of everyones lives when making legal decisions.
