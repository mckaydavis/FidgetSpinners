# HRS API
NodeJS API for the Hawaii Revised Statutes App. API includes access to statute data store and HRS search engine.

*NOTE:* This is not required to run the client. The client already has the api url that we built, so if you do run the api locally and you want to use it with the client, then you will need to update all the http request urls.
