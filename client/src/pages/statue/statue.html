            Generally. As this section does not establish the supremacy of the 1840 Constitution over the current state
            constitution, or somehow render the documents concurrent, whether chapter 431 violated the 1840 Constitution
            was immaterial for purposes of defendant&#39;s
            conviction. 90 H. 130 (App.), 976 P.2d 444. Article XII, §7 of the Hawaii constitution and/or this section
            do not authorize for native Hawaiian grandparents any more visitation rights than §571-46(7) and §571-46.3
            authorize for all grandparents,
            native and non-native Hawaiian. 112 H. 113 (App.), 144 P.3d 561.

            Background of statute; general principles. Prior to 1893, common law (usually) or civil law, not contrary to
            Hawaiian law or usage, followed as reason and equity dictated (L 1847, p 5; cc 1859, §§14, 823). 2 H. 209; 3
            H. 90, 95; 3 H. 106, 112; 5 H. 543;

            1, 1893, common law adopted
            &quot;except as otherwise provided..., or fixed by Hawaiian judicial precedent, or established by Hawaiian
            usage....&quot; Effect of Hawaiian judicial precedent: 10 H. 421, 436; 16 H. 294, 303; 20 H. 146, 149; 25 H.

            425, 429, 380 P.2d 762; 49 H. 273, 414 P.2d 925. Statute gives Hawaiian decisions &quot;the force of a
            statute&quot;. 25 H. 701, 708; 42 H.
            518, 525. Effect of Hawaiian usage: 10 H. 408 (conveyance by lessor); 10 H. 421, 436 (conveyance by
            disseisee); 12 H. 375, 391 (estates tail, fees simple conditional); 16 H. 377, 389, overruled on another
            point 25 H. 397, 405, 21 H. 74, 83 (merger

            (adoption). Rejection, previous
            to 1893, of essential parts of common law justifies present rejection of other parts; and previous
            application (contrary to common law) of a general principle to one question justifies subsequent application
            to another question. 10 H. 421, 436;

            Effect of common law on statutory construction. Torrens Act construed in light of common law. 256 F.2d 208,
            212, remanding 41 H. 490, modified 42 H. 661. Appellants&#39; contention that native Hawaiian rights were
            exclusive and possessory was unsupported
            in the law. 76 F.3d 280. If plaintiff could prove that its custom and usage of subject land, prior to 1892,
            established its right of occupancy and use based upon the doctrine of individual aboriginal title, then that
            doctrine, as established in
            1923, would apply. Any aboriginal title that plaintiff may have had was extinguished; plaintiff failed to
            show that its use and occupancy of the area was exclusive as required by the doctrine. 875 F. Supp. 680.
            Plaintiff&#39;s claims of reserved
            rights of native tenants under Hawaii law did not extend to the right of perpetual and exclusive occupancy
            upon the land of another; plaintiff&#39;s ancestors&#39; failure to claim kuleana title to subject land,
            which rendered them tenants at sufferance,
            foreclosed plaintiff&#39;s attempt to claim possessory rights to the land under Hawaii law. 875 F. Supp.
            680. Statutes in derogation of common law strictly construed. 5 H. 41; 9 H. 23, 25; 10 H. 151, 159; 22 H.
            765, 767 (explaining earlier cases);
            23 H. 541, 545; 37 H. 374, 379 (ordinance); 37 H. 571, 580; 49 H. 624, 628, 425 P.2d 1014; 50 H. 201, 436
            P.2d 752. But should nevertheless be construed in accordance with legislative purpose. 41 H. 442, 459; 44 H.
            59, 67, 352 P.2d 335. Grounds
            for annulment held exclusively statutory. 8 H. 77. Interpretation of words in criminal statute according to
            common law meaning. 8 H. 259; 22 H. 618, 629; 33 H. 560, 563. Marriage controlled by statute, no common law
            marriage. 25 H. 397. Usury statute
            as superseding common law. 36 H. 107. Statute codifying common law, interpreted according to modern
            decisions. 39 H. 460, 465, aff&#39;d 205 F.2d 616. Common law as background in applying statutes prescribing
            time and place of trial. 46 H. 197,
            209, note 4, 377 P.2d 728. The common law recognizes a cause of action for invasion of right of privacy
            where defendant uses plaintiff&#39;s name or picture for commercial purposes. 50 H. 374, 441 P.2d 141.
            Common law holds that right to rent to
            accrue on a lease of real property is an interest in realty. Rent already due is personalty. 56 H. 295, 535
            P.2d 1109. Common law rule for use of ancient documents as evidence construed. 57 H. 312, 555 P.2d 495.
            Joint owners of an animal may be
            liable in an action for injuries caused by such animal. 57 H. 620, 562 P.2d 779. &quot;Hawaiian usage&quot;
            must predate November 25, 1892. 58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725. No evidence that &quot;Hawaiian usage&quot; gave to
            owner of land along seashore
            title to lava extensions created by volcanic eruption. 58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725. Where practices have,
            without harm to anyone, been continued, reference to Hawaiian usage in section insures their continuance for
            so long as no actual harm is done
            thereby. Retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing respective
            interests and harm once it is established that application of the custom has continued in a particular area.
            66 H. 1, 656 P.2d 745. &quot;Hawaiian
            usage&quot; clause may establish certain customary Hawaiian rights beyond those found in §7-1. 73 H. 578,
            837 P.2d 1247. Common law rights ordinarily associated with tenancy do not limit customary rights existing
            under the laws of Hawaii. 79 H.
            425, 903 P.2d 1246. Descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited islands prior to 1778 who assert valid
            customary and traditional Hawaiian rights under this section entitled to protection regardless of their
            blood quantum. 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.
            Hawaii constitution and this section require county planning commission to &quot;preserve and protect&quot;
            reasonable exercise of customary or traditional native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing
            special management area use permits.
            79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246. If property is deemed &quot;fully developed&quot;, i.e., lands zoned and used for
            residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements, and infrastructure, it is always &quot;inconsistent&quot;
            to permit the practice
            of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485. To establish
            the existence of a traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation
            in the record connecting the claimed
            right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485. Where
            defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally
            protected native Hawaiian right and
            knowingly entered landowner&#39;s property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court
            properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of §708-814(1). 89 H. 177, 970
            P.2d 485.
